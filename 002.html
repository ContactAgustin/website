	<h2>Mictlan</h2>
	
            <p>Mictlan is the Aztec Empire's underworld. It is believed that most people who die travel through Mictlan's 9 Levels. This journey takes about 4 years with the aid of Xolotl. It is ruled by King Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Underworld and his wife Mictecacihuatl, Lady of the Underworld.</p>
            
            <p>In one of many accounts it is said that in Quetzalcoatl's quest for human creation he was fooled by Mictlantecuhtli. The Lord of the Underworld knew of his quest and set a pit trap. When the Feathered serpent asked for the bones of the previous human creations he put him on a side quest. He sent Quetzalcoatl around Mictlan four times blowing into a conch shell without any holes. To make noise he inserted bees into the shell, thinking he fooled the king, in return Mictlantecuhtli showed him the bones that he was in search of. However, he was not aware of the trap that the king had set, causing Quetzalcoatl to break some bones. This was a way to explain why humans can be so different from one another.</p>
